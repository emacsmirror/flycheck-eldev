Make {uri-flycheck}[Flycheck] use proper dependencies in
{uri-eldev}[Eldev] projects.

For a project to be detected, it must contain file `Eldev` or
`Eldev-local` in its root directory, even if Eldev doesn’t strictly
require that.

TIP: If you are using {uri-flymake}[Flymake] and not Flycheck, check
out a similar project, {uri-flymake-eldev}[flymake-eldev].

== Features

* No additional steps to be performed from the command line, not even
  `eldev prepare`.  However, you might need to mark the project as
  trusted, use `M-x customize-group flycheck-eldev RET`.

* Project dependencies are seen by Flycheck in Emacs.  Similarly, if a
  package is not declared as a dependency of your project, Flycheck
  will complain about unimportable features or undeclared functions.

* Everything is done on-the-fly.  As you edit your project’s
  dependency list in its main `.el` file, added, removed or mistyped
  dependency names immediately become available to Flycheck (there
  might be some delays due to network, as Eldev needs to fetch them
  first).

* Additional test dependencies (see `eldev-add-extra-dependencies`)
  are seen from the test files, but not from the main files.

* Also checks files `Eldev` and `Eldev-local` (as long as they are
  byte-compilable, but this is a common Flycheck requirement).  Detect
  wrong `(eldev-...)` function calls as you type!

== Installation

Download and install the package from {uri-melpa-stable}[MELPA Stable]
or {uri-melpa-unstable}[MELPA].  No further steps necessary: once the
package is installed, it is active and Flycheck will detect any Eldev
projects on-the-fly.

For the extension to have any effect, you need to
{uri-eldev-installation}[install Eldev].  If Flycheck doesn’t seem to
recognize dependencies declared in a project, verify its setup (`C-c !
v`).  Normally, you should see something like this at the top:

....
First checker to run:

  elisp-eldev
    - may enable:    yes
    - may run:       t
    - executable:    Found at /home/foo/.local/bin/eldev
    - project root:  ~/foolib
    - trusted:       yes (...)
    - next checkers: emacs-lisp-checkdoc
....

If the project is not trusted, customize some variables in
`flycheck-eldev` group.  This is a security feature to avoid running
potentially harmful code from unknown projects.  If you don’t need
this precaution, set `flycheck-eldev-unknown-projects` to `trust` (it
is still possible to actively blacklist individual projects after
that).

If you want to deactivate the package for some reason, set variable
`flycheck-eldev-active` to nil.
